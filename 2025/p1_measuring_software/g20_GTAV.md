summary: |-
  This experiment analyses the energy consumption of GTA V under different graphics settings to determine the increase in energy usage from low to high settings. To ensure our results are not dependent on a single computer, we use multiple machines to run the in-game integrated benchmark test 15 times for each graphics setting. The collected data highlights the differences in energy consumption across various graphical configurations.

# Introduction


The increased use of computers has led to a rise in global energy consumption. 
It is estimated that software will account for 51% of all electricity usage as early as 2030. 
This means that software will be responsible for 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades [(Andrae & Edler, 2015)](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/6/1/117).
As a result, software companies are placing greater emphasis on sustainability to create long-term value without harming the environment.


A branch of existing software systems that is constantly growing is the gaming industry, with about 2.6 billion global gamers and gaming titles available on almost every digital device, making video games one of the most popular and enduring hobbies worldwide [(Topic: Video Gaming Worldwide, 2024)](https://www.statista.com/topics/1680/gaming/#topicOverview). 
To satisfy this massive player base, companies strive to develop games with greater realism, improved physics engines, and enhanced graphics, all of which require more computational power. 
This is evident in the gaming industry, where new games demand increasingly advanced GPUs as minimum requirements. 
Despite this vast player base, the gaming industry has not been as proactive in addressing environmental sustainability compared to other computing technology sectors [(PÃ©rez et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06346).  


To examine whether higher graphics settings lead to increased energy consumption, we decided to measure the difference in energy usage within a single game at different graphic settings. For this study, we selected *GTA V*, which still has 30 million active monthly players 12 years after its release [(Xoob & Xoob, 2024)](https://activeplayer.io/grand-theft-auto-v/). 
To ensure the reproducibility of the experiment, we used the game's built-in benchmark test across multiple computers. Our results show that...............


# Methodology
During the experiment, it was crucial to measure the energy consumption of the selected game as accurately as possible while minimizing interference from other background programs.
This is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of our results across different computers.
A background program that significantly affects energy consumption in one test might not be running on another system, leading to inconsistencies in the results.
To achieve this, we closed all unnecessary programs, keeping only essential background services running.
These were indicated by taskbar icons and included Windows Defender, the NVIDIA app, Epic Games Launcher, Rockstar Launcher, and the audio driver.  


Furthermore, we placed emphasis on warming up the system before starting the experiment and allowing cooldown periods between each run. This was achieved by running a non-recorded warm-up benchmark test before data collection and restarting the game between runs, which takes about a minute to ensure proper cooldown.  


We compared two different graphics settings, classified as a low graphics quality run and a high graphics quality run.
On each computer, we ran the benchmark test 15 times for both the low and high settings, totaling 30 runs per PC.
Initially, we considered running a higher number of tests per setting, but given that each benchmark test takes approximately 3 minutes per run, we realized this would require a significant amount of time.
To ensure reliable results, we conducted the same experiments on different PCs. This allowed us to compare the results and determine whether the difference in energy consumption between low and high settings on a single PC was consistent across multiple systems.
