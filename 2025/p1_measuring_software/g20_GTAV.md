summary: |-
  This experiment analyses the energy consumption of GTA V under different graphics settings to determine the increase in energy usage from low to high settings. To ensure our results are not dependent on a single computer, we use multiple machines to run the in-game integrated benchmark test 15 times for each graphics setting. The collected data highlights the differences in energy consumption across various graphical configurations.

# Introduction


The increased use of computers has led to a rise in global energy consumption. It is estimated that software will account for 51% of all electricity usage as early as 2030. This means that software will be responsible for 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades [(Andrae & Edler, 2015)](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/6/1/117).  As a result, software companies are placing greater emphasis on sustainability to create long-term value without harming the environment.


A branch of existing software systems that is constantly growing is the gaming industry, with about 2.6 billion global gamers and gaming titles available on almost every digital device, making video games one of the most popular and enduring hobbies worldwide [(Topic: Video Gaming Worldwide, 2024)](https://www.statista.com/topics/1680/gaming/#topicOverview). To satisfy this massive player base, companies strive to develop games with greater realism, improved physics engines, and enhanced graphics, all of which require more computational power. This is evident in the gaming industry, where new games demand increasingly advanced GPUs as minimum requirements. Despite this vast player base, the gaming industry has not been as proactive in addressing environmental sustainability compared to other computing technology sectors [(PÃ©rez et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06346).  


To examine whether higher graphics settings lead to increased energy consumption, we decided to measure the difference in energy usage within a single game at different graphic settings. For this study, we selected *GTA V*, which still has 30 million active monthly players 12 years after its release [(Xoob & Xoob, 2024)](https://activeplayer.io/grand-theft-auto-v/). To ensure the reproducibility of the experiment, we used the game's built-in benchmark test across multiple computers. Our results show that...............
